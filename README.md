## Hey there!
You're probably here for one of two things, you're either...
- a Cornell student enrolled in CS 4152/5152 Advanced Game Architecture, and are looking for my haptics library to help juice up your game,
- a recruiter looking into whether I'll be a great fit for your organization.

Regardless, here's a little bit about myself.

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Cornell. Being a long way from my hometown Malaysia, I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and I'm working on an early stage startup aiming to provide value through routing trips, and optimsing bookings for spendthrift travellers. 

In the past, I've worked on RAG Platforms at PETRONAS Digital, and have had extensive experience leading design and engineering through game creation at Cornell's Development in Games Project Team.

My motivation in CS has always been driven by a desire to work on well-engineered solutions in the tech-industry, specifically in the realm of interactive experiences like games, edge-computing and tools for creatives. 

I'm currently learning about graphics, as well as design and computing for mixed reality experiences.

I'm always interested in speaking, so feel free to reach me at ll594@cornell.edu.

Aside from engineering, I enjoy writing about film and game design, and pursue acting/performance on the side. I also like cooking and carpentry.
