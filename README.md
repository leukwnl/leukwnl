## Hey there!
You're probably here for one of two things, you're either...
- a Cornell student enrolled in CS 4152/5152 Advanced Game Architecture, and are looking for my haptics library to help juice up your game,
- someone looking into whether I'll be a great fit for your organization.

Here's a little bit about myself:

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Cornell. Being a long way from my hometown Malaysia, I currently live in Brooklyn, New York.

I’m working on an early-stage startup that optimizes travel routing to help high-spending travelers get more value from their credit card points.

In the past, I've worked on applied AI projects (RAG) at PETRONAS Digital, and have had extensive experience leading design and engineering in game creation at Cornell's Development in Games Project Team.

My motivation in CS has always been driven by a desire to work on well-engineered solutions in the tech-industry, specifically in the realm of interactive experiences like games, edge-computing and tools for creatives. 

I'm currently learning about graphics, as well as design and computing for mixed reality experiences.

Aside from engineering, I enjoy writing about film and game design, and pursue acting/performance on the side. I also like cooking and carpentry.

You can reach me at ll594@cornell.edu.
